### Expanded Lithuanian Mythology Universe

This is the fully expanded compilation of the Lithuanian (and broader Baltic) mythological universe, incorporating all deities, spirits, and figures from the unified list. Expansions include detailed backstories, motivations, attributes, relationships (family ties, alliances, rivalries, myths), and interactions to create a vibrant, interconnected world. The aesthetic leans toward horror-anime/visual novel elements: gods as ethereal yet terrifying beings with dual natures (e.g., benevolent but capable of cosmic horror through plagues, obsessions, or eternal curses). The pantheon reflects Indo-European roots (sky fathers, thunder warriors) blended with pre-Indo-European earth/fate goddesses, emphasizing cycles of order vs. chaos, life vs. death, and human-god bargains.

**Cosmic Structure**: 
- **Realms**: Dausos (sky paradise, ruled by Dievas/Vėjopatis—orchard of eternal light); Middle World (earth/atmosphere, balanced by Perkūnas/Žemyna); Underworld (inverted earth, ruled by Velnias—fertile yet decaying caves/forests).
- **Cosmogony Myth**: Dievas emerges from primordial chaos, shaping sky and earth. Velnias, his shadow-self, dives into depths to fetch mud for land but hides some in his mouth—creating hills/valleys in rebellion. Perkūnas strikes to enforce balance, igniting the first thunder. Seasons cycle as Saulė's journey: spring alliances (Perkūnas fertilizes Žemyna), summer harmony, autumn waning (Mėnulis's melancholy), winter encroachment (Velnias's frost via Blizgulis).
- **Themes**: Fate's inevitability (Laima/Giltinė), nature's vengeance (storms/plagues), trickery vs. justice (Velnias/Perkūnas). Human interactions: Offerings (bread/milk) appease; disrespect summons horrors like shape-shifting curses or ghostly hauntings.
- **Hierarchy**: Dievas (supreme, distant); Major Deities (enforcers like Perkūnas); Nature/Celestial (cyclical guardians); Household Spirits (local protectors); Minor Deities (regional patrons); Spirits/Legendary (folkloric/mythical beings).

Milda has been moved from Spirits to Major/Core Deities, as she fits as a goddess of emotional domains (love/passion), paralleling figures like Saulė (nurturing) or Laima (fate). Her debated authenticity is noted, but expanded as a romantic counterpart in the pantheon.
